### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 My name is Anastasia Ivashchenko, I live in Little Italy, Downtown San Diego, California. I was born in 1991, in a big cold city
                            in Siberia.
                            I've always been into photography but eventually chose my other field of interest - information technologies as a
                            primary source of income.
                            I'd like to share my story and portfolio, motivation, ambitions and goals with anyone who's
                            interested. You can also
                            reach out to me for colaborations using the contact info. <br>
